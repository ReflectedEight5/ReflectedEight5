Tim: idk ReflectedEight5, Someone you prob dont like at the moment, hopefully this makes you change your mind:
idk all this stuff but im going to make it simple but not quick, i do want to apoligize first of all, being an asshole is being an asshole :D, but for real:
2020 was a bad year for everyone, and specially me, ngl 2020 got harder and harder by time. 
I did not treat people well, but i think that i have aproved and became a nicer person, i dont like blaming stuff, but it was night basically all the time.
I feel like im more mature, i try to be the best i can att the moment and time, i do miss also getting pinged so, if this dont go threw then i want to get the notifications atleast.
the thing i really miss is playing with you gys, if its talking or not, hehe your welcome for the sub mister god himself?, boosting your ego :D, hope thos was enough: Tim JÃ¶nsson
